Method description, including evaluation method

To classify the hate speech, we are going to utilize both supervised learning and unsupervised learning. For supervised 
learning, we will quickly follow the same idea in project one by using decision tree and random forest. Moreover, we will also
try other supervised model such as logistic regression, naive Bayes.

But in real world, we cannot get much labeled training data. And it is a also a tedious work to label them. So we will focus
on unsupervised learning, like K-means and its variations, Hierarchical clustering, and also Spectral Clustering.
